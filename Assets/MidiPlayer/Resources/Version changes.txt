	New with MidiFileWriter2  [Pro]
		Automatic tracks creation and ending.
		Midi events sequence can be directly played with the internal MPTK midi sequencer (no temp file created). 
		New useful API available: MPTK_AddChangePreset, MPTK_AddNote, MPTK_AddChordFromLib, MPTK_AddChordFromRange... 
		Two new demos mainly based on MidiFileWriter2.  See scenes TinyMidiSequencer and TestMidiGenerator.
